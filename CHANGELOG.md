All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- Drop `view` from the component-level `mixin` attribute on `Hotwire.cfc`. Lucee 7 enforces native trait composition on `component mixin="..."` and tries to load each comma-separated value as a CFML component path; there is no `view.cfc` on the path, so the whole component failed to compile with a misleading `can't find component [vendor.wheels-hotwire.Hotwire]` error. Net effect on Lucee 7: no Turbo Drive, no Turbo Frames, no Turbo Streams, no Stimulus helpers — the package silently failed to activate. After this fix the package activates cleanly. The `package.json`'s `provides.mixins: "controller"` field remains the actual source of truth — the component-level attribute was a legacy convention obsolete on Lucee 7. Lucee 5/6 don't enforce native mixin composition the same way, which is why this went undetected until Wheels 4.0 made Lucee 7 the default. (See [#2](https://github.com/wheels-dev/wheels-hotwire/pull/2).)
